🚀 Cloud Deployment Platform – Overview

A scalable and fully-automated cloud deployment platform that allows users to deploy web applications directly from Git repositories.
The platform provides:

Automated builds

Global edge hosting

Serverless routing

Cost-efficient object storage

Centralized logging & management dashboard

Powered by Cloudflare R2 for storage, Cloudflare Workers for edge routing, AWS S3, and Redis for distributed job processing.

🔧 Architecture Overview

The platform consists of three core services, working together to provide a seamless deployment workflow.

1️⃣ Upload Service (Source Ingestion)

The Upload Service handles importing a user’s GitHub repository into the system.

✔ How it works

The user submits a GitHub repository URL.

The service clones the repository and uploads the entire source code into AWS S3.

A unique project ID is generated.

This ID is pushed into a Redis queue for processing by the Deploy Service.

📦 Responsibilities

Git repo cloning

Archiving and uploading project source to S3

Enqueuing new deployment jobs into Redis

Returning the deployment ID to the user

2️⃣ Deploy Service (Build & Deployment Pipeline)

This service processes job IDs coming from the Redis queue and performs the actual build.

✔ How it works

The Deploy Service listens to the Redis queue.

When an ID arrives, it downloads the corresponding project source from S3.

The source is analyzed:

If it’s a React / SPA project, it is built and converted into static HTML, CSS, JS.

Any other static assets are processed as well.

The final optimized build output is uploaded back to S3 / Cloudflare R2 under the project’s deployment path.

📦 Responsibilities

Pulling build jobs from Redis

Downloading project source from S3

Running builds (React → static assets)

Uploading optimized build output

Updating Redis with deployment status

3️⃣ Request Service (Edge Rendering & Delivery)

The Request Service is responsible for serving the deployed project to end users.

✔ How it works

Incoming requests are routed via Cloudflare Workers.

The subdomain is parsed to determine the project ID.

The Request Service fetches the corresponding static assets from Cloudflare R2 / S3.

The correct Content-Type headers are applied.

Files are streamed back to the client quickly and efficiently.

📦 Responsibilities

Edge routing based on subdomain / custom domain

Fetching deployed build files from S3/R2

Serving HTML, CSS, JS, and assets

Global caching and fast response times
